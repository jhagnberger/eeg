# Homework 2

> 1. In your own words, what was the research question?

They investigate whether the N170 peak is related only to faces or whether it is related to recognize things where a person is an expert in vs. recognize things where the person is not an expert in.

> 2. Using an if/then statement, what was the hypothesis? The “if” part should relate to the theory, and the “then” part should relate to the expected ERP results.

If the N170 peak is related to expert/non-expert, then the ERP should show a larger peak if people process information from their domain of expertise.

> Complete the table below describing the order of trial events and their timing.

| Event Number  | Event Name         | Timing         |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 1             | Fixation           | 1000–1500 ms   |
| 2             | Category           | 255 ms         |
| 3             | Fixation           | 570 ms         |
| 4             | Picture            | 255 ms         |
| 5             | Fixation           | 735 ms         |
| 6             | True/False Prompt  | Until response |

Possible events: Picture, Category, Blank, Fixation, True/False Prompt possible timings: 255ms, 570ms, 735ms, 1000-1500ms, until response

> 4. To which event in the trial structure was the event-related potential synchronized?

To the category

> 5. What were the dependent variable(s) in the reported ANOVAs?

Mean amplitudes within the time window ±24 ms
(±2 SD) around the peak latency (i.e., 140 to 188 ms)

> 6. What were the channels of interest, and how did they decide which ones to analyze?

Channels: 51, 52, 58, 59, 60, 65, 66, 85, 86, 91, 92, 93, 97, 98.

The channels selected for the N170
analysis were determined by identifying the electrode sites in the left and right hemispheres where the amplitude of the grand-averaged N170 was maximal across all conditions. 

> 7. Does the graph in Figure 2 plot negative UP (the wrong way) or DOWN (the right way)?

Negative is plotted down.

> 8. Figure 3 shows the scalp distribution of the mean voltage differences in the expertise effect. Do you think these results support a functional (qualitative) difference between experts and novices, or a quantitative difference, and why?

Yes, because we can observe a difference for the right hemisphere (right head picture).

> 9. Based on the results of this experiment, do YOU think an enhanced N170 component is domain-specific for faces or does it reflect expertise-related activity? Back up your answer with the statistical finding you found most relevant and convincing

I think it reflects expertise-related activity because Figure 2 shows a difference in the amplitude and they also report p < 0.001 for the higher amplitude. That convinces me that it is unlikely that this effect in amplitudes is not caused by expertise-related activity.

> 10. Suggest a follow-up ERP experiment and explain how it would extend these findings.

Future work could explore if the amplitude can be used to determine the level of expertise.

This could be done by training some machine learning model to predict the level given the amplitude or EEG signal. To collect data, experts with different expertise levels are needed and or the experts need to provide some confidence score for each recognition.
